Subject: A multipart example
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
            boundary=unique-boundary-1

This is the preamble area of a multipart message.
Mail readers that understand multipart format
should ignore this preamble.

If you are reading this text, you might want to
consider changing to a mail reader that understands
how to properly display multipart messages.

--unique-boundary-1

... Some text appears here ...

[Note that the blank between the boundary and the start
of the text in this part means no header fields were
given and this is text in the US-ASCII character set.
It could have been done with explicit typing as in the
next part.]

--unique-boundary-1
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

This could have been part of the previous part, but
illustrates explicit versus implicit typing of body
parts.

--unique-boundary-1
Content-Type: multipart/parallel; boundary=unique-boundary-2

--unique-boundary-2
Content-Type: audio/basic
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

    mu-law-format audio data goes here ...

--unique-boundary-2
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

... base64-encoded image data goes here ...
